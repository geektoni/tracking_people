# tracking_people
Tracking People with OpenCV.

The task of this assignment is to count and track people in a given video acquired from top view.

The accomplishment of the assignment will be evaluated on the two tasks separately (counting and tracking).

Counting: the student has to provide a frame-by-frame information related to the actual number of people present in the scene. As an optional task, the number of people entering/exiting a specific gate can be provided.

Tracking: for each pedestrian in the scene, provide the trajectory, as a separate output file, to be compared with the provided ground truth. As a validation metric, the average displacement error will be considered for a selected number of pedestrians.
